When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when i have to work on different workstations, or when more people is colaborating with my project.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	Because it is necessary to decide if i want those changes n my local repository or not.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 	forks occur only on GitHub while clone occurs on any repository in doesn't matter if it is local or remote. Branches work only in the current repository.
