When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when i have to work on different workstations, or when more people is colaborating with my project.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	Because it is necessary to decide if i want those changes n my local repository or not.
